# Crystal Collector
## Description
Crystal Collector is a game that can be played in the browser. The game will provide a random number, and the user will have to try and match that number by clicking on the crystals. The only catch is that the user won't know the value of each crystal until they click on it! Give it try here: https://khoernlein90.github.io/CrystalCollector/ Good luck and have fun!
